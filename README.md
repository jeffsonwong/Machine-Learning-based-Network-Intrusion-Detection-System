# Machine-Learning-based-Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
This project develops a machine learning-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using models like Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost to improve detection accuracy and address issues in traditional NIDS, such as high false positives and unknown attack detection, using the UNSW-NB15 dataset.
